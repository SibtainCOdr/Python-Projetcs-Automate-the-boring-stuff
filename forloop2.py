#for loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times.
#  The Python for statement iterates over the members of a sequence in order, executing the block each time.
#  Contrast the for statement with the ''while'' loop, used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration,
#  or to repeat a block of code forever
